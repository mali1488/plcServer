<div class="container"><h2>About modbus</h2>
<p>
	MODBUS is an application layer messaging protocol, positioned at level 7 of the OSI model, 
	that provides client/server communication between devices connected on different types of 
	buses or networks. 
	<br><br>
	Each modbus message is composed of a ADU.<br> ADU = Adress(url) + PDU + Error, 
	where <br> PDU = Functioncode + data(start pin, end pin).<br><br>
	<img src="./img/modbus.png" alt="picture should be here"></img>
	<br><br>
	Example request: ADU = "ip/my/url" + PDU, where <br>PDU = 4 (read input registers) + (0 + 4)(read from pin 0 to pin 4). <br>In the request we dont have any Error.
	<br><br>
	<h3>Function codes</h3>
	The function code field of a MODBUS data unit is coded in one byte. Valid codes are in the 
    range of 1 ... 255 decimal (the range 128 â€“ 255 is reserved and used for exception 
    responses). When a message is sent from a Client to a Server device the function code field 
    tells the server what kind of action to per
    form.  Function code "0" is not valid. 
    <h3>Data</h3>
    Data is not always needed depending on what function code is sent in the PDU. For example
    if the function code is 7 (Read Exception Status), there should be no additional data. But
    if the function code is 6 (Write Single Register), there should be 4 bytes of data. 2 bytes 
    telling the register address and 2 bytes containingthe new value that should be assigned to
    that register.
